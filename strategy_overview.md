Developing a content strategy for your Twitter account is crucial to ensure you're consistently delivering valuable content that resonates with your audience. Here are the steps to help you start:

1. **Define Your Goals:** What do you want to achieve with your Twitter content? This could be building brand awareness, establishing yourself as a thought leader, driving traffic to your website, or fostering community engagement. Your goals will guide your content creation process.

2. **Understand Your Audience:** Since you're aiming to grow your followers, you'll want to cater to the interests of your existing followers while also appealing to potential followers. Check out who's currently following you and interact with them. What are they interested in? What kind of content do they share or engage with? 

3. **Decide on Content Themes:** Based on your goals and your audience, decide on a few key themes for your content. You've mentioned you're passionate about leveraging resources in the cloud to solve problems, so that could be one theme. As a father and husband, you could also share content about balancing work and family life. 

4. **Create a Content Calendar:** A content calendar helps you plan what you're going to post and when. Plan for a mix of different types of content related to your themes. This could include:

   - **Educational Posts:** Share your knowledge about cloud technology. This could be in the form of tips, how-to guides, industry news, or thought leadership articles.
   
   - **Personal Posts:** Share about your personal life to connect with your audience on a human level. This could be experiences as a dad, funny moments, or motivational posts.
   
   - **Engagement Posts:** These are posts designed to get a response from your followers. They could be questions, polls, or requests for opinions on a topic.
   
   - **User-Generated Content:** If your followers or those you follow create content that aligns with your themes, share it!

5. **Develop a Posting Schedule:** Consistency is key on Twitter. Decide how often you can realistically post and stick to it. Aim for at least once a day to start with, but remember that Twitter moves fast, so more frequent posting can be beneficial.

6. **Measurement and Adjustment:** Use Twitter's analytics tools to see how your posts are performing. Look for patterns in what types of posts get the most engagement and adjust your strategy accordingly.

Remember, a content strategy is a dynamic thing. It should evolve as your audience grows and changes, and as you learn more about what works and what doesn't on your platform. The most important thing is to stay authentic and genuine.
