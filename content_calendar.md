Absolutely, here's an adapted version of your weekly content calendar with three posts per day:

**Friday**

**Saturday**
- Morning: Share a thought or reflection about a trend in your industry.
- Afternoon: Tweet about a personal hobby or interest outside of work to show your followers a different side of you.

Remember, this is just a guide, and it's important to be flexible and responsive to what's happening in real-time on Twitter. If a significant event happens in your industry, you may want to comment on it immediately, rather than sticking strictly to your planned content.
